/*SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCRIPT:
	There are some oddities with the default rotation of some of the objects in the protopack, one of these being that the plane's nose points backward along the Z-axis. To circumvent this, I have placed the plane model from the protopack into an empty gameobject and then flipped the plane's z-object. This empty gameobject is the object that contains this script. This allows us to use transform.Translate(0, 0, 1) to move forward, rather than backward. 
	To get the propeller of the plane to spin, you need to drag the propeller object into the 'propeller' slot of this script.*/

/*ABOUT
	The first thing that is done in the Update() function is rotating the propeller. This is for display only - you can remove it without killing your plane.

The next thing we do is define a defaultTilt Quaternion. Basically what this vector does is take the rotation of the plane and sets the x and z values to 0 so the plane is not nosing up or down and is not turning. Note that this does not affect the plane itself in any way - it is just an unused Quaternion(until later).

The next thing we do is read input and modify the eulerAngles of the transform based on input. Left/Right arrows turn the airplane, so we rotate along the y-axis. Up/Down arrows nose the plane up and down, so we rotate along the x axis. Note that there is some funky business going on with the up arrow - it is commented below.

If none of the arrows keys are pressed, then we smoothly rotate the plane back to it's original rotation(the defaultTilt).

Have fun!
